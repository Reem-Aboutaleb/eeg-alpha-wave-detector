# 🧠 EEG Alpha Wave Detector
![Alpha Band EEG Plot](alpha_wave_plot.png)

This project uses Python and the MNE library to load, filter, and visualize EEG brain signals — specifically targeting **alpha wave activity** (8–13 Hz). Alpha waves are linked to relaxation, meditation, and quiet wakefulness.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- ✅ Loads real EEG data from the MNE sample dataset  
- ✅ Filters signals to isolate alpha band frequencies  
- ✅ Visualizes clean alpha waveforms from EEG channel data  
- ✅ Built using Jupyter Notebook (runs in Colab)

---

## 🔬 Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) — for EEG signal processing
- **Matplotlib** — for signal plotting
- **Google Colab** — for cloud-based execution
- Git & GitHub — for version control and publishing

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Compute and compare power across EEG bands  
- Visualize alpha power heatmaps across channels  
- Build a Streamlit dashboard for interactive EEG exploration
